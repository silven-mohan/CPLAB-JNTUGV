## TurboC Compiler
**TurboC** is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and compiler developed by Borland, widely used for learning C programming, especially in educational institutions. It combines an editor, compiler, and linker in a single package, providing an easy-to-use interface with a simple menu-driven environment. TurboC runs primarily on DOS and older Windows systems, making it popular for beginners but largely outdated for modern development. It supports traditional C (C89) and includes a built-in debugger, making it valuable for students learning fundamental programming concepts and debugging techniques without dealing with complex modern toolchains.

## GCC Compiler
**GCC** (GNU Compiler Collection) is the most widely-used open-source compiler suite for C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran, Ada, and Go. Maintained by the GNU project, GCC supports modern C standards (C89, C99, C11, C17, C23) and runs on virtually all operating systems including Linux, Unix, Windows (via MinGW), and macOS. GCC is the default compiler on most Linux distributions and offers powerful optimization flags, extensive error messages, and excellent documentation. It's the industry standard for professional development and is freely available, making it the go-to choice for open-source projects, embedded systems, and commercial software development worldwide.
